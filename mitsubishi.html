               <h2>About Mitsubishi  </h2>

               <h2>The Challenge
            </h2>
            <h3>Balancing quality, budget and timing.
            </h3>
               <p>Before Lumen5, MHI was working with multiple media and content creation agencies but saw a need for more competitive costs and quality performance. Plus, the video making and editing processes were lengthy and had to go through endless vetting. Instead of following their goals—producing diverse, stellar and affordable content in no time—the result was often to compromise with mediocre, expensive and fewer videos. Even though they had a lot of great content on Spectra, they were missing a robust tool to help them repurpose it in another format (i.e. video) and quickly post it on social media to further boost engagement.

               <h2>The Solution      </h2>
               <h3>Professional videos without the high price tag.
            </h3>
               <p>When LinkedIn told MHI they should do more video content because it performs better, they knew that first, their workflow had to change. Here’s what happened next: LinkedIn recommended Lumen5, they signed up for the free trial and ended up loving it. Thanks to Lumen5’s intuitive interface, the editorial team realized they don’t need to be video production experts to create engaging videos for their events, expos, and social media accounts. Lumen5 also doesn't cost the early and the tool helps MHI get the job done quickly. Being able to make in-house videos without any extensive training helped them diversify their content to better engage with the target audience.

            </h2>
            <h3>Videos that drive traffic and fully connect with audiences.
            </h3>
               <p>It’s been less than a year since MHI and Lumen5 got together—and things are looking up. They’ve been putting out five times more video content than before, boosting their traffic. Their videos get two times more impressions than any other type of content. At least half of the content they now share on LinkedIn are Lumen5 videos, which raised their engagement rate. MHI hasn’t just found a way to produce more videos cheaper—they managed to fasten their workflow and stay true to their brand.
