                <h2>About NC State
                </h2>
              <p>NC State University is a leading public research university with more than 36,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It’s made up of 12 different colleges based in North Carolina. Each year, NC State adds $6.5 billion to the statewide economy, the equivalent to creating more than 90,000 new jobs. It has a social media hub where their marketing and branding processes are centralized. The University targets anyone from prospective students to current students, alumni, donors, and parents. "The way we work—we're like a vehicle. We draw out the creative direction and provide all the tools and software people need to do their job (like Lumen5, Hootsuite, Brandwatch, etc.), plus training. We hired a social media specialist for each college—who are like the drivers. They follow the main strategy but can decide if they want to take that left or go straight. It’s a combined effort that works great for us."

                <h2> Challenge</h2>
                <h3>Make videos like a pro (affordable, engaging and in less time)
                </h3>
              <p>The University’s social media team did not have the bandwidth to shoot high-end videos, so they were working with a videographer who trained them in using Adobe After Effects and Premiere. But creating and editing videos was taking too much of their time—they needed to free up their schedules and deliver projects faster. That’s not all. Metrics showed their social media videos were not always performing well. Since one of their main goals was to raise the number of views, shares, likes, and comments, they were missing a robust tool they could use to churn out text-based videos and better engage their audiences.

                <h3>Lumen5 and NC State University: a match made in heaven.
                </h3>
              <p>When NC State University found Lumen5, it was love at first sight. In the beginning, NC State University was happy with generating attractive text-based videos in a timely fashion. With Lumen5 regularly releasing new features, they were able to add sound bites, use different cropping options and pick layouts that match their branding. The tool’s availability goes hand in hand with the social media team’s needs. If there's an event on campus, they can shoot directly with their phones and create videos on the go. Plus, Lumen5’s features allows them to produce content they can repurpose for other platforms. Lumen5’s little tweaks are improving NC State University’s social media game, allowing them to stay on brand and level up their creativity.
