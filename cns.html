            <h2>The Challenge
            </h2>
            <h3>Create more and cheaper videos to skyrocket LinkedIn engagement.
            </h3>
           <p>In the past, when CMS needed video content for social media, they hired a video production agency based in the UK. However, the entire process was time-consuming and expensive, so they were not able to create content regularly and on the fly. The videos are used mostly for the website and social media – especially LinkedIn, which is the most important social media platform for B2B business. However, LinkedIn changed its algorithm last year when it started to push the usage of videos on the platform. Due to this change, CMS’s impressions and engagement went down. It turns out LinkedIn videos earn three times more engagement than text-only posts. That’s when CMS realized that its global teams need a powerful tool to consolidate their marketing efforts to make people fall in love again with their content and generate more leads. By using Lumen5, the impressions increased as well as the click-through-rate and engagement. Last year, CMS was able to increase the number of generated leads by 14% and its LinkedIn followers by 47%.

          <h2>The Solution
        </h2>
           <h3>Lumen5 at first sight.
        </h3>
           <p>The lawyers at CMS create a lot of legal content such as downloadable publications and guides that need to be promoted on social media. Creating a 30-second teaser video in Adobe Premiere used to take social media teams an entire day. With Lumen5, they now only need 20 minutes. They can leverage the generous media library, quickly add images, drag and drop scenes and add saved templates to stand out from the crowd. Compared to working with a complex video creation tool where they had to think about the scenes beforehand and write scripts or hire an expensive agency, using Lumen5 is a no-brainer for the teams at CMS.
