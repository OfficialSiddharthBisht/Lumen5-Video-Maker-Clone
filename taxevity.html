            </h3>

They specialize in life and health insurance and operate in Ontario and British Columbia.

           <h2>The Challenge</h2>
           <h3>Adding value while making a name for oneself.</h3>
           <p>Promod Sharma has been creating content to help audiences better understand finance since 2007. He started blogging, did some podcasting and then, together with his son, moved on to video interviews. With zero experience, video creating and editing turned out troubling, taking a lot of their time. Plus, with video interviews, the focus was always on their guests—not on promoting their products and services. They had to find a better way to showcase their brand and financial expertise to attract more leads.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <h3>An affordable and uncomplicated video creator.
            </h3>
           <p>Taxevity was looking for the right tool to help them achieve their goals: educate their audience, boost brand awareness and improve referral traffic. It had to be affordable, intuitive and easy to use. They signed up for the free trial and ended up subscribing. Lumen5 helps them create educational content about insurances, sharing tips for advisors and adding more value to their audience. I think Lumen5 is intuitive and gets better with time. It’s got a nice balance of useful features and no clutter. They’re constantly adding new ones and making improvements. It’s like shopping at Costco: there's always something new.

         <h2>The Results </h2>
<h3>More value, more time, more views and a more consistent brand.
</h3>        
  <p>Taxevity is the type of business that enjoys having a small number of superfans instead of a large list of apathetic followers. We measured Taxevity’s success with Lumen5 in terms of consistency. Before Lumen5, it was hard for them to be consistent with video making. Now, they can sit down for an hour once a week and create short, engaging videos to share with their audience. They are currently making two videos a week, which increased video production volume. By adding their brand elements to all their videos, they’ve created a consistent brand
