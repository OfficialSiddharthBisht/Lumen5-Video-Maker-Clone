               <h2>The Challenge
            </h2>
            <h3>Turn lengthy content into catchy videos.
            </h3>
               <p>When DNV GL decided to invest more in their digital presence, they realized video content would make their social media accounts stand out. They also had lengthy, influential reports they needed to turn into engaging videos without spending a fortune on video specialists. So, they started producing video content in-house. However, the whole process of downloading stock videos, exporting them to Adobe Premiere, editing and sharing them with the team was taking a lot of time. Plus, many team members were hesitant about their video making skills.

                </h2>
                <h3>Hassle-free video making.
                </h3>
                <p>Social media videos are important to DNV GL and so is having access to high-quality stock videos. When licensing media directly from stock footage providers got expensive (1000 € for a one-minute-video), they started looking for an affordable online tool to simplify their workflow. The company’s Media Relations and Video Content Manager, Peter Lovegrove, had his colleagues try several online tools. Lumen5 scored high in terms of usability, costs and customer service. DNV GL uses Lumen5 to tell authentic stories that bring the company closer to its audience. The platform's intuitive interface makes the video creation process painless. They choose the right video template and Lumen5 does the rest.
                </p>
                <p>"Customer service is essential to us. Thomas, our Account Executive, was extremely helpful and conducted an onboarding webinar to explain to the team how the platform works. In short, I feel like the Lumen5 team listens to our concerns and has our back"

               <h2>The Results
            </h2>
            <h3>Improved social media click-through rates and higher-levels of engagement.
            </h3>
               <p>Thanks to Lumen5, DNV GL makes more social media videos. Their average is six videos per month, but there were months when they did fifteen, which is huge progress. Creating videos with Lumen5 videos is four times quicker than before, so they’ve been saving a lot of time to focus on other projects. DNV GL’s most important goal was driving brand awareness. In-house reports show Lumen5 videos outperform all other formats and boost engagement.            </p>
         <p>"When we analyzed how Lumen5 and talking-head videos perform, we found that Lumen5 videos had better click-through and engagement. We really missed having a powerful and intuitive tool at hand."     </p>
