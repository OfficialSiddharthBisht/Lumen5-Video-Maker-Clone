                <h2>About Mondadori
                </h2>
                <p>Gruppo Mondadori is an Italian publishing giant and market leader. The 100-year-old company was one of the very first Italian publishers for magazines and, subsequently, digital publications. In 2016, Mondadori acquired Banzai Media, a move that allowed Mondadori to create cross-media brands that speak to millions of people through a variety of touchpoints. Every month, Mondadori brand publications reach 16 million readers, 31 million unique online users, and 33 million followers across their core social networks. All brand activities are managed through Mondadori Media — a social multimedia subsidiary that oversees an impressive portfolio of leading Italian brands. The Mondadori media team consists of 450 professionals, including marketing specialists and content editors, who manage and create content. These assets range from paper publications to local events, and — of course — videos.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
               <p>For one of Mondadori’s leading travel publications, Zingarate, the social media team were looking for a new way to communicate with and engage their audience on Facebook, Instagram, and key landing pages across the Zingarate website. To help the team achieve the communication and engagement they needed, they soon pivoted to exploring video.
